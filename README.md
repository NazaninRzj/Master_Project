## I am a Master's student in Scientific Computing at the Memorial University of Newfoundland 

I am developing a new model through machine learning algorithms to predict the dispersion energies of the molecules. 
I am working in [Dr.Rowley's group](https://www.rowleygroup.net/)

I explained a bit about my Master's thesis. You could find it [here](nazaninrzj.github.io/Master-Project/) if you are interested.
