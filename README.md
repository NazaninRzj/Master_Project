## I am a Master's student in Scientific Computing at the Memorial University of Newfoundland 

I am developing a new model through machine learning algorithms to predict the dispersion energies of the molecules. 
I am working in [Dr.Rowley's group](https://www.rowleygroup.net/)

You could find some information about my Master's thesis [here](https://nazaninrzj.github.io/Master_Project/).
