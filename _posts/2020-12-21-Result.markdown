## XDM Dispersion Energy

By using XDM atomic coefficients ($C_6$), dispersion energy can be added to DFT energy. Damping function applied to avoid singularity as r --> 0. 

\mathcal{V}_{total}(r) = \mathcal{V}_{DFT}(r) + \mathcal{V}_disp(r)

\mathcal{V}_{disp,6}(r) = -f_{damp}(r) \frac {C_6}{r^6}

Many dispersion models only include $\frac{C_6}{r^6}$ term (e.g., Lennard-Jones function), but as indicated in Figure below for nearest-neighbour dispersion interactions, higher order terms of dispersion coefficients are also important ($\frac{C_8}{r^8}, \frac{C_8}{r^{10}}$) and they contribute $\sim$50$\%$ of dispersion interaction at short range.
