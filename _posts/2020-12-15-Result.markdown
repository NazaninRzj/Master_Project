## XDM Dispersion Energy

By using XDM atomic coefficients (*C*6), dispersion energy can be added to DFT energy. Damping function applied to avoid singularity as r --> 0.

Many dispersion models only include *C*6/*r*^6 term (e.g., Lennard-Jones function), but as indicated in Figure below for nearest-neighbour dispersion interactions, higher order terms of dispersion coefficients are also important (*C*8/*r*^8, *C*10/*r*^10) and they contribute ~50% of dispersion interaction at short range.

The figure below illustrates that methane has the highest *C6* distribution compared to ammonia and water since carbon has greater atomic polarizability.

As shown in figure below,  the magnitude of the *C6* coefficient decreases with increasing oxidation number because of decreasing the electron density.
